Exemplary Code for Simulating two Interconnected Neural Mass Models Described by the Normal Form of a Supercritical Hopf Bifurcation.



List of Parameters:

intrinsic frequency f of both regions (standard value: .05)
coupling strength G scaling the adjacency matrix connecting the two regions (standard value: 1)
local bifurcation parameters a1 and a2 for the two regions respectively (standard values: .0, .0)
scaling factor ß of noise (standard value: .02)
